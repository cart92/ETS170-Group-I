% Context Diagram

\section{Domain Overview}

ShopMate has an excessive inner domain, communicating with various other systems. In order to fulfill some of the fundamental requirements, 
this is necessary. Figure  below represents the domain level of ShopMate, displaying the systems needed to provide the desired functionality.

\subsection{Context Diagram}
ShopMate has an excessive inner domain, communicating with various other systems. In order to fulfill some of the fundamental requirements, this is necessary. Figure \ref{fig:contextdiagram} below represents the domain level of ShopMate, displaying the systems needed to provide the desired functionality.  \\ \par

We are only implementing the ShopMate application, and thus only communicating with the other (already existing) systems interfaces 
(Parking System, Navigation System, Public Transportation, database). A minimalistic version of the product is also to be implemented on 
Smart-Watches, where only the essential parts of the application is used. For more information about what functionality exists on what 
device and what functionality is limited by not having internet connection see table 1 and 2 in the appendix on page \pageref{app:A}. \\ \par

The following states the overall requirement defined by the context diagram. \\ \par

\underline{Context diagram --- Functionality} \\  The product shall support the interactions defined in the context diagram.\\ \par

\underline{Context diagram --- Interface} \\ The product shall support communication with the existing interfaces that are present in the mall today.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{The context diagram for the ShopMate system, describing its domain level.}
    \label{fig:contextdiagram}
\end{figure}

The Location System is used to locate where the user is in the mall to make navigation possible. Mall Data System is a database that 
contains all the necessary data concerning the stores, products, offers, prices and stock balance. Public Transport is the system used 
by the public transport provider, and provides the timetables for the ShopMate to give advice concerning public transportation to the mall. 
Parking System is the external system used by ShopMate to find parking spots and finding parked vehicles.
