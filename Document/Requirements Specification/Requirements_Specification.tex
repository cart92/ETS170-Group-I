% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
Our customer is planning to open a brand new shopping mall and would like to stand out from their competitors. In order to do this and at the same time 
increase customer value, they have asked us to develop an application called ShopMate for the mall. The product ShopMate will help the customers of the 
mall, e.g. creating a shopping list, receiving special offers and finding their way around the mall. The shop owners are hoping the product will increase sales 
and attract new customers to the mall. They will also be able to promote their individual stores through the application.

%==================================
% Business Goals
\subsection{Business Goals}

The purpose of the product is to enhance the experience of a customers visit by offering some features that facilitates their stay. 
With the provided functionality of the product, the customer satisfaction will increase, as well as the number of visiting customers and the 
number of sales for the stores. This will enable the mall owner to charge the stores higher rents and a higher revenue for the stores in the mall.

\subsection{Terminology}
	\begin{description}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
	\item [The product] is referring to the ordered system. The product consists of an application for the operating systems; Android and iOS. 
	In addition to the application there shall be support for a Smart-watch and a server/database to store information in.
	\item [Smartphone] is a mobile phone with internet connection, touch screen and possibility to install applications from Google play store or App store depending if the Smartphone runs Android or iOS as operating system.
	\item [Smart-watch] is an iOS- or Android-wearable, in other words it\qu s a connected device that communicates with a Smartphone and can run lightweight applications.
	\item[The user] is referring to the person using the application on their device.
	\item[Device] is referring to the unit the user is running the app on, e.g. Smartphone and Smart-watch.
	\item [Offers] are store-products or services that are being sold att a lower price in the stores a the mall. Offers are displayed on the user\qu s screen of their devices.
	\item [The server/database] is where all data about stores, offers, store-products, maps and so on are stored.
	\item [Store] refers to companies located in the mall. 
	\item [Store-product] refers to items/products being sold in the stores, not the product that is being developed.
	\item [Location] refers to the location of a user or a store in the shopping mall. 
	\item [Shopping list] refers to a list with items or store-products that the user has added to a list and intends to buy while at the mall.
\end{description}

The requirement ID\qu s are meant to help the reader to know what section of the report they address. 
They also increase awareness in the project and can be used to not have to state the whole requirement every time they are mentioned. \\ \par

The requirement ID\qu s are formatted after which category they are active within, and complemented with a few words describing what function they fulfill. For example a business requirement starts with "Business" followed by their function, e.g. "Customer satisfaction". Which will give the following requirement ID: \textit{Business --- Customer satisfaction.} The same technique is used for all the other areas of the requirement specification as well. 

%==================================
% This is where the requirements start.
%==================================


%==================================
% Business
\section{Business}

Here we address requirements regarding the business goals for the product. 
This is how our customer will be able to profit from the product. \\ \par

\underline{Business --- Customer satisfaction} \\ The product shall increase the shopping malls customer satisfaction.\\ \par

\underline{Business --- Mall revenue} \\ The product shall increase the malls yearly revenue by 4 \%. \\ \par

\underline{Business --- More customers} \\ The product shall help increase the number of visiting customers to the mall by  \\ 8 \%.\\ \par

\underline{Business --- Increased sales} \\ The product shall help increase the number of sales the stores have by 3 \%. \\ \par

%==================================
% Context Diagram

\section{Domain Overview}

\subsection{Context Diagram}
ShopMate has an excessive inner domain, communicating with various other systems. In order to fulfill some of the fundamental requirements, 
this is necessary. Figure \ref{fig:contextdiagram} below represents the domain level of ShopMate, displaying the systems needed to provide the desired functionality.  \\ \par

We are only implementing the ShopMate application, and thus only communicating with the other (already existing) systems interfaces 
(Parking System, Navigation System, Public Transportation, database). A minimalistic version of the product is also to be implemented on 
Smart-watches, where only the essential parts of the application is used. For more information about what functionality exists on what 
device and what functionality is limited by not having internet connection see table 1 and 2 in the appendix on page \pageref{app:A}. 
The following states the overall requirement defined by the context diagram. \\ \par

\underline{Context diagram --- Functionality} \\  The product shall support the interactions defined in the context diagram.\\ \par

\underline{Context diagram --- Interface} \\ The product shall support communication with the existing interfaces that are present in the mall today.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{The context diagram for the ShopMate system, describing its domain level.}
    \label{fig:contextdiagram}
\end{figure}

The Location System is used to locate where the user is in the mall to make navigation possible. Mall Data System is a database that contains all the necessary 
data concerning the stores, products, offers, prices and stock balance. Public Transport refers to the system used to be able to provide the users with timetables 
of the local public transport. Parking System is the external system used by ShopMate to find parking spots and finding parked vehicles.
